# plotter_4_lephare_python
This is a LePHARE .spec file visualizer, written in Python. It will show the available solutions spectra, PDF and the information of each solution.

Requirements: numpy, matplotlib, sys, os, and tabulate
This first version presents all data as a matplotlib output, and a text table with the data of each found solution, so that the user may copy it from the terminal.

This script detects if it has the spec file as an external argument. If there is no argument, it will enter interactive mode and as for the file.
